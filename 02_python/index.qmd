- [**Flow, Loops, and Classes**](python-flow-loops-classes.qmd) – Introduces control flow, loops, and classes in Python, including how to write functions and use loops effectively.
- [**Miscellaneous Applications**](python-apps/index.qmd) – Covers miscellaneous applications of Python, including data manipulation and analysis with pandas, data visualization with matplotlib, and machine learning.
