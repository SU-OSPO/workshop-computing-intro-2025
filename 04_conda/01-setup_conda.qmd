## Install `conda`

The conda lesson needs `conda` to be installed. There are several different ways to install `conda` (Anaconda, Miniconda, Miniforge); we will use [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main). To install, do the following:

::: {.callout-note}
To install `conda` you'll first need a shell installed. If you haven't done it yet, install a shell following the instructions [here](00-setup.qmd).
:::


1.  Open your terminal application and `cd` into your home directory by typing:

    ```bash
    cd
    ```

1.  Follow the instructions [Quickstart install instructions](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions) on the Miniconda website. Take note:

    *   **Windows users**: **do not select the "Windows Command Prompt" or "Windows PowerShell" tab**. Instead, click the **Linux** tab and follow those instructions. This is because you will either be using git bash or WSL, both of which emulate Linux. Mac users, follow the macOS instructions.
    *   Run the commands listed in the instructions from your home directory by copying and pasting the commands into the terminal that you opened in the first step.

1.  Once the installatino is done, open a new terminal window for the installation to take effect. If the installation was successful, you should see `(base)` to the left of your command prompt. This means that you're in the `base` environment.
